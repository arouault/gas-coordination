In our report, we found something sobering:

> "Gas companies indicated that they often acquiesce to municipal paving requests out of a desire to repair frayed relationships that have occurred to due past poor coordination."

We have no doubt the reverse happens in many cases, as well.

Regardless of the direction, acting out of deference or an attempt to repair a working relationship can itself continue to harm that relationship, because the party acquiescing can, if nothing changes, feel taken advantage of and become bitter over time.

Nobody enjoys working in a tense environment with damaged relationships, yet repairing relationships can be challenging.

If your utility or municipality is in a working relationship like the one described, consider appointing or hiring a neutral facilitator to help resolve tension and bring back productive communication.
