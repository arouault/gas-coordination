<p>Homeowners and businesses may request new gas services in areas with active paving moratoriums, but utilities and municipalities can help avert these conflicting requests.</p>

<p><strong>Municipalities</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Maintain and share moratorium information proactively. Ideally, this information would be available online, and in spatial data formats.</li>
  <li>Prior to the construction season, notify homeowners and businesses on streets that are slated for paving of the impending moratorium.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Utilities</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Provide municipalities with flyers to announce paving and the impending moratorium. These flyers could increase new service sales for the gas company.</li>
  <li>Enact policy to prohibit direct mail, call or email campaigns for new customers on segments of road that are within the five-year moratorium.
    <ul>
      <li>Note: General radio, internet or television ads may still bring in new customer requests.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ensure the sales division has access to and is aware of municipal moratorium information.</li>
</ul>
