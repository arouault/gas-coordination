<p>In order to provide smooth, two-way communication, utilities and municipalities should proactively share contact information for key staff and provide critical data.</p>

<p><strong>Utilities</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Create online-accessible list of gas company key contacts.
    <ul>
      <li>This list should mention key contacts' areas of responsibility.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Provide a mechanism so that municipalities can notify supervisors if they are not receiving a timely response from the designated key contact / staff member.</li>
  <li>Develop a list of municipal data that more than one department in the company needs, and ensure proper access to those records.
    <ul>
      <li>Provide a way to notify staff when data is updated.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Municipalities</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Use the utilities' key contacts list to communicate with the right person.</li>
  <li>Actively provide utilities with data when requested, and proactively notify key contacts when data is updated.</li>
</ul>
