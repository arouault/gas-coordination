<p>In our report, we found something sobering:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Gas companies indicated that they often acquiesce to municipal paving requests out of a desire to repair frayed relationships that have occurred to due past poor coordination."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have no doubt the reverse happens in many cases, as well.</p>

<p>Regardless of the direction, acting out of deference or an attempt to repair a working relationship can itself continue to harm that relationship, because the party acquiescing can, if nothing changes, feel taken advantage of and become bitter over time.</p>

<p>Nobody enjoys working in a tense environment with damaged relationships, yet repairing relationships can be challenging.</p>

<p>If your utility or municipality is in a working relationship like the one described, consider appointing or hiring a neutral facilitator to help resolve tension and bring back productive communication.</p>
